## Purpose of Unit Tests
Unit tests are a type of software testing that focuses on verifying the correctness of individual units of code, typically functions or methods. They are an essential part of the software development process, helping to ensure that code is reliable, maintainable, and bug-free.

## Unit Tests for the AuthenticationController
The unit tests provided for the `AuthenticationController` cover the following aspects of the controller's functionality:

### CreateUser:

- Verifies that the `CreateUser` method throws an exception when the provided username already exists.
- Verifies that the `CreateUser` method returns a `CreatedResult` when the provided user data is valid and the user is successfully created.
### AuthenticateUser:

- Verifies that the `AuthenticateUser` method returns an `OkObjectResult` with a valid JSON Web Token (JWT) when the provided credentials are valid.
- Verifies that the `AuthenticateUser` method returns an `UnauthorizedResult` when the provided credentials are invalid.

## Benefits of Unit Tests
Unit tests provide several benefits to the software development process:

- Improved code quality: Unit tests help to ensure that code is well-written, modular, and easy to test. This leads to more reliable and maintainable code.

- Early defect detection: Unit tests can identify defects early in the development process, when they are less expensive to fix.

- Increased confidence in code changes: Unit tests provide a safety net when making changes to code, giving developers confidence that the changes have not introduced new defects.

- Reduced regression risk: Unit tests help to prevent regressions, which are defects that are introduced as a result of changes to code.

Overall, unit tests are an invaluable tool for developing high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software.
